# XML Test Automation
## Problem
When testing XML files, it is time-consuming to manually generate and modify multiple files for each test case. Additionally, each file must have a unique ID to meet processing requirements. Similarly, manually creating the required structures in the software, such as buyer and seller profiles, adds to the testing time.

## Solution
The XML Test Automation project aims to streamline the testing process by providing a solution to easily configure and generate test files with unique IDs. It automates the creation of software structures necessary for processing the XML messages and facilitates independent testing of each message. Furthermore, the project generates comprehensive test reports to track and analyze the test results.

## How It Works
The program reads XSD files containing the structure definitions for the XML messages to be tested. The structure information is stored in an Excel file for easy management.

Within the Excel file, a DEFAULT case is provided as a template. Test cases are generated by duplicating and modifying the DEFAULT case, ensuring unique IDs and customized content for each scenario. Another Excel file, EBASE struct, allows defining the desired content for each structure to be generated in the software.

A base XML file is created using the DEFAULT case as a starting point. Please note that currently, the namespace in the generated XML must be manually edited to match the content of a real message. Although this step can be automated in the future, it is not frequently required.

The program generates XML and JSON files. JSON files are read by the program to set up the test scenario, while XML files represent the messages to be processed within the scenario.
